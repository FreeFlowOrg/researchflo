" Open access refers to research outputs which are distributed online and free of cost or other barriers, and possibly with the addition of a Creative Commons license to promote reuse. "

For more information on what Open Access Journals are, please refer to the following link :

We feel that costs and accessibility of academic research papers are factors that bring down quality of research in our country and we are trying to remove those factors to promote research more among students in our country.
